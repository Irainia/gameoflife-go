# Game of Life

## Description

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves, or, for advanced players, by creating patterns with particular properties.

## Rule

The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead, (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

1) Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2) Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3) Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4) Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed; births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick. Each generation is a pure function of the preceding one. The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.

## Dependency

### Go Programming Language

The Go programming language version `go1.12.9` should be installed. Go to [this link](https://golang.org/doc/install) and follow the instructions to install based on the system. To check the installation, we can check its version by running the following command on the terminal:

```zsh
go version
```

Example of the output:

```zsh
go version go1.12.9 darwin/amd64
```

### Go Dep

The Dep, for dependency management tool for Go, version `v0.5.4` should be installed. Go to [this link](https://github.com/golang/dep) and follow the instruction to install based on the system. To pcheck the installation, we can check its version by running the following command on the terminal:

```zsh
dep version
```

Example of the output:

```zsh
dep:
 version     : v0.5.4
 build date  : 2019-06-14
 git hash    : 1f7c19e
 go version  : go1.12.6
 go compiler : gc
 platform    : darwin/amd64
 features    : ImportDuringSolve=false
```

## How to Test

In order to test, go to this project root directory and run the following command:

```zsh
make test
```

## How to Build

In order to build, go to this project root directory and run the following command:

```zsh
make build
```

A new directory named `bin` (if not already there) will be created, containing the built project.

## How to Run

After building the project, in order to run, go to this project root directory and run the following command, fill in the [alphabet] value yourself:

```zsh
make run inputtype=[a] inputpath=[b] outputtype=[c] outputpath=[d] generation=[e]
```

Notes:

* [a]: can either be `file` (if you want the input to be read from a file) or `custom` (if you provide a way to get the input)
* [b]: the location of the source, can be file location if the input type is `file` (the extension should be *.cell) or any other source if it's `custom`
* [c]: can either be `file` (if you want the output to be written to a file) or `custom` (if you provide a way to put the output)
* [d]: the location of the target, can be file location if the output type is `file` or any other target if it's `custom`
* [e]: number of generation (should be whole number more than zero)

Example:

```zsh
make run inputtype=file inputpath=./input/glider.cell outputtype=file outputpath=./glider.cell generation=5
```

The input and output file has the following limitations:

* living cell will be written as character `o`
* dead cell will be written a character `-`
* each line will be separated by new line character
* there's no empty line allowed
* the shape of the cell state should be in rectangle
* providing an all-dead state will result in error
* file extension should be `*.cell`

Warning:

If `inputtype` or `outputtype` or both are set to be `custom`, then you need to provide the custom type that abide by the interface in `contract.go` inside `io` directory of this project. So, for `inputtype`, you have to provide a type that follows `io.Reader` while for `outputtype` would be `io.Writer`. In contrast, you don't have to put value to `inputpath` for `inputtype` and `outputpath` for `outputtype` respectively.

Example `inputtype`, for the input will be custom, while the output will be in the form of file.

```zsh
make run inputtype=custom outputtype=file outputpath=./glider.cell generation=5
```

Example `outputtype`, for the output will be custom, while the input will be from a file.

```zsh
make run inputtype=file inputpath=./input/glider.cell outputtype=custom generation=5
```

Example for both input and output will be custom.

```zsh
make run inputtype=custom outputtype=custom generation=5
```

*Don't forget to provde the `io.Reader` or `io.Writer` or both when initializing the `param`*
